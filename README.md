# Logic Game Collection

Logic Game Collection is an educational desktop **Java** application 
which offers a few logic games based on famous problems from 
computer science and mathematics. Games come with brief 
description of the problem and interesting facts.

This application was part of my bachelor thesis.

**Java 8  and JavaFX** were used.
Thanks to XML configuration it is possible to edit and add new game levels easily.
Internationalization was kept in mind so all texts are prepared for translation to other language.

I made custom graphics nad images for user interface in Adobe Photoshop.
